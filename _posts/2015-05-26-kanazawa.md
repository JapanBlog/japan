Kanazawa is near the northern coast of Japan where it meets the Sea of Japan. It's best known attraction is Kenroku-en (兼六園, Six Attributes Garden), one of the Three Great Gardens of Japan.

My room in Kanazawa was above a cafe and I enjoyed having a chat with the staff over a morning coffee. They did a pretty decent latte, which I really appreciated since this is unusual in my experience so far. Coffee is very popular in Japan, but it seems to be me that the classic espresso-based drinks aren't the locals' favourites and, consequently, these can be a bit hit-and-miss. Instead, iced-coffee is very popular, but I think these tend to be made with a long-black or filtered coffee, and I'm not so keen on these. Coffee drinks are also standard in any vending machine or convenience store, along with tea drinks, and are both super popular.

The gardens of Kenroku-en are exquisitely maintained by an army of workers.

Many of these gardens contain trees that are well over one hundred years old, and you will often see these propped up with bamboo scaffolding.

After walking for some time, I stopped at one of the shelters for a break and to read. I then continued walking only to realise, in a panic, that I'd lost my camera. This is Japan though, and I found my camera sitting on the bench where I'd left it 15 minutes earlier.

Up until now, I hadn't seen many people in traditional Japanese dress, apart from the relatively plain yukatas around the onsens. I knew that the wearing of kimonos was more common around Kyoto, but I also spotted a few women dressed in their best and taking photos around Kenroku-en.

On my way walking to the station to catch the train to Kyoto, I walked through the Omicho Market. Although on the smaller side, there were many interesting food stalls, many selling the excellent local seafood.

Arriving in Kyoto at 8pm, I was very hungry and went to a family-run izakaya (居酒屋). Luke had asked me whether I'd yet tried plum wine, umeshu (梅酒), so I made sure to order some when I spotted it on the menu - very tasty and sweet, would drink again.
