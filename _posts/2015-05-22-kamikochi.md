Today I am going to the Kamikochi, a mountainous highland valley within the ChÅ«bu-Sangaku National Park. In previous trips overseas I've been limited to mainly exploring the major cities, owing to less money and a tighter schedule. So I've really been looking forward to visits such as today's.

The trip to Kamikochi from Matsumoto is on a local one-track train line part of the way, followed by a scenic bus ride through the mountains.

There are several easy day tracks, along with more strenuous single-day and multi-day hikes into the mountains. I rambled along the day tracks, much of which follow the Azusa river. The river's water is a stunning torquoise. This makes it easy to take beautiful photos, especially when combined with the surrounding snow-capped mountains.

There were several signs warning of the dangers of the black bears that live in the area. Unfortunately I didn't spot any and I doubt they would spend too much time near the day trails that are busy with walkers (many with bells attached to their bags to make their presence known).

That evening I went to a recommended Japanase curry restaurant. Japanese curries are [rather different](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_curry) from Indian curries, despite taking their inspiration from these (via the English navy). This evidently caught some fellow tourists off-guard, as they made a hasty exit upon seeing my food. Fools, it was delicious.
