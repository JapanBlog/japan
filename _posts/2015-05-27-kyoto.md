A quiet day. I was wary of developing temple fever (an underappreciation of temples and shrines simply because you've seen so many of them in a short space of time), and I had several days in Kyoto, so I was in no hurry.

I caught the subway to Central Kyoto and walked around. It was hot and humid, the first day I wished I'd been wearing shorts and thongs instead of jeans and boots. My face was also rather hirsute. I hadn't brought a razor with me, so I went to the enormous Yodabashi electronics store to buy a beard trimmer.

In the afternoon I finished reading the _Wind-Up Bird Chronicle_ by Haruki Murakami. This is the second book I have read by him, the other being _IQ84_. I'm glad Kartikk recommended it to me, as I enjoyed it even more than _IQ84_; Murakami is a wonderful writer.
