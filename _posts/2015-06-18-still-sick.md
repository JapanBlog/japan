Yep, definitely sick. Thankfully, the dormitories have excellent air-conditioning and there is good wifi, so I spent the day napping and watching Netflix.

In the evening I felt a bit better and went out onto the balcony again. There I met a couple from Holland, Andreas and Elvy. We were having a good chat until after the sunset, when we realised that none of us had yet eaten and so we walked to a local restaurant. For the first time I was the designated interpreter for a group of people! We successfully ordered some great food, including the local favourite of bitter melon (with some help from folks at the hostel).

By the night's end, however, I had a heavy cold and was feeling rather frustrated by it.
