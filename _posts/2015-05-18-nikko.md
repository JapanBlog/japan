Today is the first day of my 21 day JR Rail Pass and, true to form, I was going to get my money's worth. Leaving my room at 6:20am, I headed towards Ueno station where I was to catch the Shinkansen to Utsonomiyaand then a local train to Nikko. The shrines and temples of Nikko are one of [18 World Heritage sites in Japan](http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/indepth/scenic/worldheritage/). Nikko is a couple of hours by train north of Tokyo and is where Ieyasu Tokugawa, the first shogun (feudal military ruler) of the isolationist Edo period (1603-1868), is enshrined in the Toshogu Shrine (東照宮).

Given these credentials, I was naturally not alone in setting Nikko as my destination. In fact, as I learnt when I arrived, the crowds were larger than normal owing to the Spring festival to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Ieyasu Tokugawa's death. Lining up for a parade is A Thing in Japan, as I had already learnt at [DisneySea]({% post_url 2015-05-14-disneysea %}). Japanese people will happily grab a scrap of paper, a rug, or a mini fold-up chair, and plonk themselves along a parade route more than an hour before it's due to start. Having chosen to walk uphill to the shrines rather than catch the bus, I decided I could happily sit for the 40 minutes or so until the festivities commenced. The parade was known as the _1000 people in 100 costumes_. There were samurais, men on horseback, and children dressed as monkeys who scooped up the coins thrown in prayer at the three mini-shrines called mikoshi (御輿). Fortunately, the cast of thousands (well, 800 or so) was well-described in both Japanese and English by the female MCs.

After the parade I wandered around the Toshugo shrines. Nikko itself is in the mountains and some 1300m above sea level. The shrines set on a lovely forested hill, but my enthusiasm was somewhat dampened by the big crowds. I decided to head off an hour earlier than I'd planned in order to sooner arrive at my next destination, Kusatsu, where I was to spend the next two nights.
