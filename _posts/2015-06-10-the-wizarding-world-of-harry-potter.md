I like to think that I read Harry Potter before it was cool. Sure, I read it before it was cool because I was being uncool in a book club, but I enjoyed the world created by J.K. Rowling. And today I visited that world, or at least the licensed theme park version of it, by going to the _Wizarding World of Harry Potter_ at Universal Studios Japan.

There may be other rides and worlds at Universal Studios, but I reckon 100% of the attendees were there for Harry Potter. I arrived early to get to the front of the inevitable queues. Entry to Harry Potter world is normally subject to a free timed-entry ticket in addition to the regular Universal Studios ticket. I followed the sprinting crowds through the main gates at a dignified Kel Knight powerwalk speed. To my surprise, rather than finding myself in line for the timed-ticket vending machine, I ended up inside Harry Potter world - I was lucky enough to get through in the first batch!

Making the most of this fortune, I headed straight for the main attraction, _Harry Potter and Forbidden Journey_, a 3D virtual rollercoaster through an adventure containing many famous characters from Rowling's universe. The lines for this ride can easily extend to 4 or 5 hours on a busy day. Fortunately, the queueing area itself is fully kitted up with Potter gear to keep you entertained and I got through in a breezy 70 minutes.

It was worth the wait. The ride was bloody marvellous and I was grinning just like everybody else when I came out. There is actually only one other ride that is part of Harry Potter world, a pretty boring rollercoaster in the style of the old _Dragon_ at Luna Park.

But most people don't seem bothered since there is the recreation of Hogsmeade, the only wizarding village in England in the Potter books. Here you will find many of the famous shops from Harry Potter such as _Honeydukes_, _Olivanders_, _Zonko's Joke Shop_, _The Three Broomsticks_, and the _Hog's Head_.

Most importantly, you can drink butterbeer, which is __freaking delicious__.

After spending a few hours in Harry Potter world, I went to check out the rest of Universal Studios with plans to return later in the day. I went on a bunch of rides including:

- The _Spiderman_ ride, which was another great 3D virtual ride.
-   _Backdraft_ was a mystifying explanation entirely in Japanese of an old Ron Howard film about firefighting. But the pyrotechnics at the end were pretty cool and the heat was intense.
- The _Woody Woodpecker_ show was a live animation, also entirely in Japanese but completely understandable because of the cartoon-y acting. Really clever and surprisingly really good!
- The _Jaws_ boat cruise was brilliant! Our boat captain, again speaking entirely in Japanese, was heaps of fun and I got thoroughly soaked since I was sitting on the front edge.

Why people insist on sitting next to their friends and don't use the single rider lines, which are available for many of these rides, is beyond me. It cut down my waits for some of these rides from well over an hour to five minutes. There loss, my gain.

After this I went back to Harry Potter world for a late lunch at the Three Broomsticks. Some roast chicken, pork ribs, corn on the cob, and another butter beer later, I went to see how bad the lines for the main ride and was surprised to find them even shorter than earlier in the day.

So I rode that a few more times, each time enjoying it all the more, and happily wiled away the early evening there before heading home.
