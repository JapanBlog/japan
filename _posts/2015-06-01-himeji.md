Today I am leaving Kyoto for Hiroshima. It's only a couple of hours journey on the shinkansen, but I am breaking it up with a stop to see the magnificent Himeji Castle.

Only recently re-opened following extensive restorations, the castle dominates the skyline of Himeji, being 46m tall, with a brilliant white exterior, and sitting on a hill at the end of the main road. It would have provided a very strategic vantage point when in use.

I think that most would agree that Himeji is the most picturesque castle in Japan. However, I found the tour of the interior less interesting than in Matsumoto, perhaps because of the similarity of castle insides, but also due to feeling a bit rushed by the larger crowd in Himeji.
