On the last day of my JR Rail Pass I caught the shinkansen from Tokuyama to Osaka, a two hour journey. The JR Rail Pass has been well worth it and the train a fantastic way to see the main islands of Japan. I now have five nights in Osaka, the second largest city in Japan.

I was to meet my former Japanese teacher for lunch. Kisai-san, who is now back living in her home town of Osaka, taught me for the majority of my classes at iJapanese in Melbourne. I'd given myself 20 minutes to find a locker to store my bag and then meet up with Kisai-san. That proved insufficient as literally every single locker was in use, and the overflow baggage room at capacity. So I trudged over to meet Kisai-san with my large backpack, resigned to taking it around with me for the day. Fortune shone on me, however, when Kisai-san spotted an empty locker at a nearby station as we made our way to lunch.

It was great to catch up with Kisai-san, whom I hadn't seen since September. We had okonomiyaki for lunch, different from the style [I ate in Hiroshima]({% post_url 2015-06-03-hiroshima %}), and [yakisoba (焼きそば)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakisoba).

We then had a look around some interesting shops, including Don Quijote, a kind of Reject Shop writ large with a seemingly limitless range of the useful and the useless products at dirt cheap prices.

I was using Airbnb for the first time and my accommodation was in the 'burbs of Osaka. So at 4 o'clock I said goodbye to Kisai-san and boarded a local train to Shinobugaoka. My host, Yuki-san, met me at the station and drove me to his nearby home. In fact, Yuki-san also owned the neighbouring house, where he lived with his wife, and I essentially had the run of the upstairs of the house his brother lived in. Yuki-san spoke excellent English, having lived in the USA for 30 years before returning to Japan to retire. In his retirement he is teaching English, amongst a few other things from what I could gather. He was a very kind and generous host, and all this for less than the cost of a bed in a hostel dormitory.
