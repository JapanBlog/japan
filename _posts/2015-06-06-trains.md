My plan today was to catch a ferry to Gunkanjima, an island 15km from Nagasaki that was abandoned in the 1970s and now is a kind of modern day ruins. I didn't realise how popular a spot this was, however, and all the boats were fully booked for weeks in advance. Facing another damp day, I caught an earlier train to Tokuyama, which itself was really only a rest stop on my trip to Osaka the following day.

This journey was to take a bit over 3 hours so I took the opportunity to catch up on some diary writing.

Tokuyama is a real nothing city for a tourist, so I continued to write and plan some other parts of my trip once I arrived. Part of this planning required me to make my first phone call in Japanese, to call a hostel on the remote Rebun Island at the very north of Japan. It's definitely harder than speaking face-to-face, but, fingers-crossed, there should be a bed for me when I arrive in a few weeks.
