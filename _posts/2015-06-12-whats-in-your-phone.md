Today I flew from Osaka to Naha in Okinawa. Since I didn't do much else, and I'm trying to write an entry for each day of my trip, I'm going to include here some of the things I've written as notes in my phone during my trip. There's little rhyme or reason to these observations, although weird T-shirt slogans do feature prominently. Also, all are copied verbatim from my notes.

- Fleece shorts are a thing in Japan.
- If you're tall then you'll be smacking your head all over the place in Japan.
- A restaurant where cooked spaghetti in a creamy sauce was dropped into an enormous half-wheel of cheese. The pasta was then scraped back out to serve.
- Most luxury European cars, e.g., BMW and Mercedes, are left-wheel drive despite Japan driving on the left. I guess this means they are direct imports but I don't understand why they don't have right-hand drive versions like we do in Australia.
- A dude brought his pet rabbit to Nikko.
- _Lobe you more every day_ - written on a woman's shirt in Kusatsu.
- Japanese cars are almost silent at rest or in slow moving traffic because so many of them are hybrids or automatically switch off the engine when idle.
- At a British-themed pub that is playing a boy band style cover of Beth by Kiss (they've now played this song twice in the space of 60 minutes). Now it's a piss-weak cover of School's Out by Alice Cooper. I've noticed this a lot in Japan, they often play weird, weak covers of popular songs, e.g., instrumental, orchestral Beatles tunes. It's like they're trying to avoid paying music licensing fees.
- __regret__ |rɪ\ˈgrɛt| (_noun_): The feeling after buying what you think is a cold orange juice from a vending machine only for it to be hot tea.
- There is a dog wearing a nappy in Takayama.
- _Expert. Reward. Vaunt._ - written on a T-shirt spotted in Kanazawa.
- _DEFINITELY. STAUNCH. MODERATION_ - written on a T-shirt spotted in Nara (printed in the style of the _PARENTAL ADVISORY. EXPLICIT CONTENT._ that used to be affixed to CDs).
- _Vain, Time & Space_ - written on a T-shirt spotted in Nara.
- Japanese men's wallets would be called a purse in Australia.
- _Never give up girls, rice, and snow_ - written on a T-shirt spotted in Shibuya.
- Full service petrol stations are still very common in Japan. It looks like driving a tiny hatchback into a Formula 1 pit stop.
- Getting in early, in Osaka there is a pub advertising that it will be showing the 2018 World Cup. Book your seats now, folks.
- _Loser Hotline: 1900-900-COOL_ - written on a T-shirt spotted in Harry Potter World.
- _I can grow a mustache_ - written on a T-shirt spotted in Naha. Wearer of said T-shirt notable for his lack of mustache.
- There's no need for an iron in Okinawa. Simply wear your wrinkled clothes outside and the humidity irons them for you.
- Watching music concert on a TV in a Russian restaurant. The concert is a pop/rock thing in a huge classical theatre. There's a dude playing a solo on a _melodica_, one of those mouth keyboard instruments. Michael Bluth with a mullet on djembe. Sheldon Cooper is on drums. A guy wearing a tie and baseball hat is on keys. The singer is a used car salesman who is now rapping with a stout 50+ year old wearing sunglasses. Both men wearing sunglasses, suit jackets, and jeans. Now doing an incredibly stilted version of Love Me Tender. This singer is clearly loved, he is being given several florists worth of bouquets by admirers.
- Re Okinawa: I haven't seen this many Hawaiian shirts since my grade 6 graduation.
- Ground staff, e.g., baggage handlers, at Naha airport wave goodbye to you as your plane departs.
- Hawaiian pizza has corn on it in Japan.
