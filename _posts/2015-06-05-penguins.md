Well, I just came the closest I have to missing my train. I also got to experience the Japanese subway crush, with the added inconvenience of my big backpack. I had to skip the first two trains because I simply couldn't get on, and by then I felt I had to get on the next train. However, Stupid Me forgot to check where this next train was actually going...Some backtracking and two train changes later, I made my train to Nagasaki with a couple of minutes to spare. It wouldn't really have mattered had I miseed it, still, __CRISIS AVERTED__.

It's a two hour journey from Fukuoka since Nagasaki isn't served by the Shinkansen. Out the window it's a very wet and grey looking day, so I'm not yet sure what I'll get up to once I arrive.

Yep, it's wet old day in Nagasaki, all right.

I dropped my bag off at the hotel and made plans for something to do indoors. Although no phone calls were necessary to make these plans, I couldn't help but notice that the telephone in my room, _Irene_, was involved in some sort of poll to gauge the popularity of the mid-19th century Polish composer, Frédéric Chopin.

Anyway, the Nagasaki Penguin Aquarium sounded just the ticket for a wet day timetable. Although quite small, this was a fun place to spend an afternoon. There were very few people there and so I was able to get up close during feeding times.

There were a few other tanks with animals aside from the penguins, but they were definitely the stars of the show.

I think the [videos](https://goo.gl/photos/vR3GheysKfC3UYA2A), although out of focus at times, do a better job than the photographs of capturing the fun of the penguins.
