Late yesterday I was feeling a bit under the weather with a sore throat. I woke up much the same with the added bonus of mild nausea. After sleeping in until 10AM or so, I felt up to venturing into Ishigaki City.

I didn't do much. I found an air-conditioned spot - it was 34 degrees with 100% humidity - and did some writing and reading. After an early and really tasty dinner of Okinawan food - tuna sashimi with [sea grapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caulerpa_lentillifera), deep fried tofu in a peanut sauce, and chilli prawns - I headed back to my hostel.

I hope that tomorrow I'll feel up to a bit more so I can enjoy some snorkelling at the beautiful beaches or kayaking through the mangroves.
