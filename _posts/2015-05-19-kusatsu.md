Kusatsu is a popular onsen（温泉) town, north-west of Tokyo. An onsen is a large hot bath, with the water naturally heated by volcanic springs, and is usually shared with other people. Oh, and like a bath, you go naked. More on that in a moment.

Onsen towns are popular getaways for Japanese people. As such, most of the accommodation are traditional Japanese inns called ryokan (旅館). In a ryokan, the rooms are traditional "Japanese-style room" (Washitsu, 和室). Washitsu typically have straw mat floors (tatami, 畳), sliding doors (fusuma, 襖), paper-windowed room dividers and windows (shōji, 障子), a low table with leg-less chairs (zaisu. 座椅子) or cushions (zabuton, 座布団) on the floor for seating, and a futon (布団) for a bed. The ryokan I stayed in was a big building and had a very quiet, relaxing atmosphere.

The staff softly greeted you as they went about their work in kimonos (着物). And I joined the other guests strolling around in the _de rigueur_ yukata (浴衣), a type of lightweight kimono kind of like a dressing gown, and slippers/sandals. In short, it is awesome.

It can also be expensive, especially if you choose in-room dining. These meals are fairly elaborate multi-course affairs, in a style called kaiseki (会席). Being solo and not wanting to break the bank, I forwent the meals in favour of putting my hard-earned towards staying at a ryokan with the convenience of in-house onsen.

I'd been forewarned on the etiquette associated with using an onsen. Before entering the onsen proper, you must take a shower. The shower is of the type you'd find at a public swimming pool with a bonus tiny stool for squatting. You must be completely scrubbed and clean before entering the onsen. Then you <strike>jump</strike> slide gracefully into the onsen and relax. Except, at the least the first time you try it, you'll likely be anything but relaxed. Public nudity aside, you'll be worrying about onsen-etiquette. And you'll then realise just how hot the water really is (more than 40 degrees in some). But once you adjust, it really is lovely. I particularly liked the outdoor baths, where the outside temperature and breeze made it less stuffy and humid.

Having successfully negotiated the onsen, and enjoyed it, I wandered around Kusatsu. It's quite a small town and not overly touristy, perhaps because it caters more towards a local clientele. I discovered the nectar of the gods at the 7-11, maple milk tea. It's basically like drinking a cup of maple syrup; probably not something you want to do every day, but perhaps every other.
