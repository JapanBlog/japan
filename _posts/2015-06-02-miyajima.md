Checking the weather forecast last night, I saw that today was going to be fine while rain was predicted for tomorrow. Wanting to make the most of the good weather, I headed for Miyajima, an island a short ferry ride from a Miyajimaguchi, a neighbourhood of Hiroshima.

Miyajima is famous for its "floating" [torii (鳥居)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torii) and the nearby Itsukushima Shrine. I also had heard from someone staying at my hostel that there was a good 1-2 hour hike up the island's peak, Mt Misen (535m).

I walked from the jetty and was greeted by one of the island's many deer. [Unlike in Nara]({% post_url 2015-05-29-nara %}), these animals were less interested in the people wandering about, no doubt due to the lack of biscuit sellers.

It was high tide when I arrived on the island, which is when the torii "floats" about perhaps 30 metres off shore shore.

After taking the requisite photographs, I walked through the extensive jetty-based Itsukushima Shrine and witnessed a Shinto service.

Shinto is a religion that developed in Japan and is practised by roughly 80% of the population, although most to a fairly minor extent ([according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto)).

While interesting, I think it would be a shame to visit Miyajima and only see the torii and the shrine. The rest of the surrounding area is mostly restaurants and souveneir shops. Omiyage (お土産), as souvenirs are called in Japan, [are a huge part of Japanese culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souvenir#Souvenirs_as_gifts).

If you head slightly inland, however, there are some nice hiking trails to the summit of Mt Misen.

It took me around 90 minutes to the summit, stopping several times along the way to rest out of the heat. But there was no escaping the humidity and I was slick with sweat.

I didn't see many people on the trail, one of several to the peak, so I was surprised to see so many people at the shelter at the summit. It was then I learnt that there is in fact a cable car! I was still glad to have hiked as there were good views out to sea and I spotted quite a few lizards and other animals along the way.

I went back the way I came, grabbed a late lunch, and caught the ferry back to the mainland. Despite my lunch, I was very hungry by the time I arrived back in Hiroshima. Yesterday I'd seen an Indian restaurant at the train station that took my fancy, but by the time I arrived today it had closed for lunch. A quick search online revealed a popular Indian restaurant nearby that was opening in half an hour. I had a great feed there while watching Bollywood music videos
