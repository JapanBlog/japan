Upon Yumoto-san's recommendation, I stopped off at Nagano on my way from Yudanaka to Matsumoto. There was a large Buddhist celebration at Zenkō-ji. I didn't fully understand, but basically there was an enormous pole in the forecourt of the temple that people, almost all Japanese, were lining up to touch for luck. It was a hot day, the line was long, and, to be frank, I didn't see the point in it all, so after looking at a few of the temples and statues I boarded I boarded the train to Matsumoto.

Matsumoto's most famous attraction is Matsumoto Castle (Matsumoto-jō, 松本城). The castle is nicknamed "Crow Castle", though I preferred "Castle Black" (one for you Game of Thrones fans). Bits and pieces of the complex date back to different times, but the exterior of the keep is from the late sixteenth century. The main keep is a very cool building, completely made of wood and with six floors. The beautiful gardens around the castle made it a very nice place to spend a sunny afternoon.

After visiting the castle, I experienced a familiar difficulty. It's late afternoon, it's too early for dinner, and you just want a place to sit with a drink for an hour or so. Unfortunately, although not perhaps unsurprisingly, Japan lacks pubs in the English tradition. As I wandered around in the heat looking for a place to sit and read for a while, I spotted the "Old Rock" pub, in the vein of an "Irish" pub. Now, such an establishment normally has little resemblance to anything Irish but, through the window, it did promise comfy seats and local beer, and it would be opening in about an hour. I went to a nearby coffee shop in the meantime, where I was served a most ornate iced coffee in a golden goblet.

Come dinner time, I went back to the pub and tried a Japanese ["real ale"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cask_ale). I struck up a conversation in Japan-glish with the guy sitting next to me. Toyo-san was a manager for Harmonic Drive Systems, a Japanese robotics company. Over food and a tasty Japanese whisky (that I wish I could remember the name of) I explained to him the intricacies of footy while he showed me pictures of robots - a most excellent dining companion who became only better when I learnt that he had paid my bill when I went to do so myself. Thanks, Toyo-san!
