Time to see some of the sights of Kyoto. The major sites of Kyoto can be roughly divided into Western and Eastern Kyoto. Today I was going to view those in the west, in an area named Arashiyama.

After a short train ride from Central Kyoto, I first headed towards the bamboo grove. There is a short path that meanders through densely planted bamboo that are tens of metres tall. While a great beautiful sight, the understandable popularity of the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove meant that it was a little busy to fully appreciate.

Afterwards I visted the Tenryuji Zen Buddhist temple.

The grounds here, along with those of the Okochi Sanso Villa, which I also visited, were beautiful examples of expansive Japanese gardens.

Although I was better dressed for it, it was another hot and humid day. Unfortunately I'd also had a terrible night's sleep, which, combined with walking in the heat, meant I was knackered early in the afternoon. I retreated back to Kyoto for a lie down, probably not having explored Arishiyama to its best.
