My initial plan had been to catch a tour bus to Shirakawa-go and then onto Kanazawa. Shirakawa-go is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and famous for its gasshō-zukuri (合掌造り, "prayer-hands construction") thatched roof farmhouses. The bus wasn't covered by the rail pass, however, and so I changed plans to the cheaper option of walking 15 minutes from my hostel to the Hida Folk Village (飛騨の里, Hida no Sato).

Hida no Sato is really a museum rather than a village, the buildings having been moved there from neighbouring towns and villages. It has a bit of a Sovereign Hill vibe - you can do dress-ups, learn crafts, and play old-fashioned Japanese games - but the farmhouses are kept as the central attraction.

These are magnificent wooden structures with tall, triangular, thatched roofs designed to cope with heavy snowfall. Viewing the different examples of these, all in great condition, meant that I didn't feel I'd missed out on much by skipping Shirakawa-go (although, there you can stay overnight on one of the farmhouses, which could be cool).

This was my last day in the Northern Alps, and I'd really loved visiting the region. The scenery is beautiful and the weather is perfect for long walks at this time of year. I'd definitely recommend including a visit to some of these towns in a visit to Japan.

Now, onto Kanazawa and then the Kansai area!
