A little tired of walking, I hired a biycle today to visit Eastern Kyoto. It was a beautiful sunny day, which of course meant I got burnt and sweaty. Nonetheless, there's something about cycling that makes me happy and Kyoto, like elsewhere in Tokyo, was easy to get around by bike. The one difficulty is knowing where to park, because if you get it wrong you're bike will be taken away. It seems you're more likely to have your bike taken away by the police or parking inspectors than to have it stolen.

I started at Ginkaku-ji, a Zen temple with yet more beautifully detailed and kept gardens.

I then crept along Philosopher's Path. I've noticed quite a few cats, strays I presume, wandering the streets of Japan, and along the way I came across some sort of feline rest station.

I ended up at Nanzen-ji, another Zen temple, but rather than look around the temple and the gardens I parked my bike and headed to what I thought was a 15 minute walk into the hills surrounding the temple. In fact, it was part of a much longer hiking track and it was just that most people were turning around at a certain statue. I was wearing thongs rather than my hiking boots, but it was so nice walking along here, with the trees providing some much needed shade, that I decided to press on regardless. The 90 minutes or so I walked was on quite an easy track. However, the few people that I did bump into, almost all 60-ish year old Japanese couples with hiking poles, expressed their shocked amusement at my lack of equipment.

On my descent I could hear what sounded like drums in the distance. As I got back to my starting point, I realised that what I was hearing was clapping, foot stomping, and flamenco guitar. I jumped on my bike and soon found that there was a Spanish festival on at a nearby public square. I had a quick look around at the food stands but couldn't figure out how to buy anything since I lacked the coupon book that everyone was using to pay. The people performing the flamenco dancing were technically quite good, but rather seemed to lack the passion intrinsic to the music.
