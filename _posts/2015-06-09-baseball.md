I didn't get up to much during the day. I caught up on the latest episodes of Game of Thrones and Veep, and did some reading and writing. But that evening decided to go to the baseball. Baseball is low on the list of sports that I know much about - I've never even watched a full game on TV, let alone been to a game.

Baseball is the number one sport in Japan and the men's national team is ranked 1st in the world by the International Baseball Federation. Tonight's game was between the Orix Buffaloes (formed by the merger of a team in Kobe and a team in Osaka) and the Yakult Swallows (from Tokyo). Neither team is near the top of their division and this was reflected in the size of the crowd. Nonetheless, just as [at the  soccer]({% post_url 2015-05-30-j-league %}), those in attendance made a lot of noise.

As the result of a few train cock-ups by yours truly, I missed the first innings. Unfortunately, this innings included 3 runs scored by the Swallows! The swallows continued their dominance and allowed me to see a few more runs scored, including a couple of big home runs.

Apart from the game, a highlight was the beer-at-your-seat service provided dozens of (mostly) women carrying mini kegs on their backs.

Another was the releasing of the jellybaby-shaped balloons in (I think) the seventh innings. Why, I do not know, but everyone at the stadium was in on it.
