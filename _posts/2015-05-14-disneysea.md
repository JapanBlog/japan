Today I went to [DisneySea](http://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/tds/), the aquatic-themed (barely) sister to Disneyland. It's right next to Tokyo Disneyland and is, I imagine, rather similar to its land-based brethren - lots of Disney characters wandering about, parades, rides and ~~crap~~ merchandise. Oodles and oodles of ~~crap~~ merchandise.

Until a couple of years ago, when I went to Universal Studios in Los Angeles, I'd never been to a theme park. Turns out they can be pretty fun, and I'd heard good things about DisneySea, so off I headed.

First things first, Japanese people are mad for Disney. T-shirts, hats, plush toys, backpacks, keyrings, socks, stickers - you name it, they wore it or had it dangling off their person.

I'd been warned that the crowds line up early and my best bet was to join them in order get as much done early in the day as possible. Being a Thursday, this was a "quiet" day at the Disney parks. Although, since I'm not a crowd person, I still found it a bit much. I had great fun in the morning by heading straight for the rides I was most keen to try: Journey to the Centre of the Earth and Indiana Jones Adventure: Temple of the Crystal Skull. Come the afternoon however, as waiting times grew to over an hour and my mid-afternoon slump hit me, I decided to grab a beer and do a little reading amongst the insanity of Goofy dancing and singing along to Spice Up Your Life (yep, the Spice Girls song) in Japanese (why, I have no idea).

I think having a buddy along for the day would help keep spirits up during the interminable waits (and remember, these were short waits on the DisneyScale) but, all in all, it was still a great experience. I might give Disneyland a try when I return to Tokyo at the end of my trip, better prepared and perhaps less fatigued.
