Takayama is a popular town to visit due to its proximity to the Northern Alps. It also has a beautiful old town dating back to the Edo period (1600-1868) that I spent most of the day wandering through. Unfortunately, I'd forgotten my camera back at the hostel, so there aren't many photos from today.

The Sunday market was on and ran the length of several blocks along one main street. There was heaps of interesting street food to try as I snacked my way through the day.

You've probably heard of the famous Kobe beef and Wagyu beef. Well, Takayama is proud of its melt-in-the-mouth Hida beef. And unlike the $100+ Kobe steaks, Hida beef is vaguely affordable, so I decided to try it for an early dinner. Because I was so early, only the owner was working in the restaurant. He was a friendly man who acted as waiter, chef and general chatter as I enjoyed my food.
