It's a hot and sticky day in Naha. Looking for something to do that is out of the heat, the owner's of the ryokan where I am staying recommend the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium. Depsite my [earlier misgivings on aquariums]({% post_url 2015-06-08-aquarium %}), this sounds like the best option on a day like today.

Craving a coffee, I first went to Starbucks where I also updated my diary. Apparently Starbucks is the place for foreign language classes in Naha. Seated nearby where at least four one-on-one sessions in English, Japanese and Spanish. Once I finished my writing I checked the bus timetable to the aquarium. It was then I learnt that the aquarium is in fact more than two hours drive from Naha and that the next bus wasn't for another hour and a half. I really had no other option though, so I grabbed a late breakfast of pineapple and ate it at the bus stop.

Thankfully, the bus was airconditioned and the drive went along the coast of Okinawa with some nice views of the ocean. The aquarium is part of a larger __NATURE PARK__, but I only had time for the fish.

Back in Naha, I went to a Russian restaurant for dinner.
