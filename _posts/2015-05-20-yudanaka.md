Having thorougly relaxed in Kusatsu, it was time to header further into the alps and to the town of Yudanaka. Most people are going here for one thing - snow monkeys!

There are several places in Japan where you can see the Japanese macaques. You've probably seen photos of them bathing in the hot springs while heavy snow covers the surrounds. Being late Spring, I wasn't going to see snow, but the time of year meant I should get one bonus - BABY SNOW MONKEYS!

As you may have gathered, I was pretty excited. I love watching animals, particularly non-humanoid primates. But I was also a little wary and not wanting to get my hopes up. Firstly, while these monkeys were described as living in the wild, this was obviously a qualified truth since they encountered many people, and their many cameras, each and every day. Secondly, I didn't know how big the park was, weather it would be zoo-like or how many monkeys lived there and that I was likely to encounter. I needn't have feared on any of these counts.

Arriving in Yudanaka mid-afternoon via a circuitous train journey (in order for the trip to be covered by my JR Rail Pass), I walked the short distance from the station to the ryokan. This ryokan was simpler than the one I had stayed in at Kusatsu, although still very comfortable, but the owners made this a special place to stay.

Upon checking in, Yumoto-san, who runs the ryokan with his wife, asked me my plans for my two days in Yudanaka. I replied that tomorrow I'd like to go to the Monkey Park. Straight away he insisted (in a good way) that I do it now. In fact, he'd drive me there himself. He then pulled out a stack of brochures on Yudanaka and the surrounding Nagano region, and made my itinerary for not just the remainder of the afternoon, but for the next two days as well. He was to remind me of these plans every time I saw him during my brief stay (at least five times by my count) - "Monkey Park today, tomorrow Zenk≈ç-ji Temple and Matsumoto Castle".

Yumoto-san dropped me at the car park, and I had a nice scenic walk of a kilometre or two to the park entrance.

Before even getting there, I noticed some movement off the path up ahead. My first monkey! And totally nonchalant to my presence she was, as she strolled alongside me for a few hundred metres.

Rather than try to convey my excitement and enjoyment in EVER INCREASING CAPITALS AND EXCLAMATION MARKS!!!!, I'll leave it to the [photos and video](https://goo.gl/photos/NRyyUkdWTffX9V4M8).

After a week of delicious Japanese food, I thought to try something else (non-Japanese, that is, not non-delicious). Pasta possibly the mostpopular foreign food in Japan, and there was a pizza/pasta place down the road from me. I enjoyed a nice cold beer and one of the nicest spaghetti carbonara that I've eaten (no doubt helped by my hunger).
