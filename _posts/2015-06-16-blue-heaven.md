I spent my last day morning in Miyakojima back at Yonaha-Maehama Beach near the fancy hotel. I then borrowed the bike again to cycle across to Kurima Island. I grabbed lunch at _Pani Pani_ - taco pizza and blue heaven ("cream soda") spider! Best.

My next stop was Ishigaki, close to the most south-western part of Japan. The flight from Miyakojima was the shortest of my life - about 20 minutes I think - but was still on a 120-seat plane because of the popularity of the island with Japanese tourists.

The hostel in Ishigaki had a similarly relaxed beach vibe to that of the guesthouse in Miyakojima. I spent the evening sitting on the balcony writing my diary with a beer from the vending machine (at least until the mosquitoes arrived).
