Miyakojima is a popular get away for Japanese people. Like the rest of Okinawa Prefecture, the climate is tropical and there are excellent beaches. Apart from accommodating tourists, the rest of Miyakojima is mostly plantations of sugarcane. Walking around the island it would remind me of northern Queensland.

The guesthouse owner was supposed to meet me at Miyako airport, but after waiting for half an hour I jumped in a cab. The guesthouse was fairly isolated and there was no one there when I arrived. I knew there was a good beach nearby so I dropped my stuff and made for it. As I was walking down the road, a minivan driven by the guesthouse owner waved me down. He apologised and explained that due many roads were closed on the island due to a bike race, which I'd seen on my cab ride over. He suggested I visit a closer beach and I was happy to take him up on this advice.

Yonaha-Maehama Beach is a long stretch of white sand and the water is a turquoise blue owing to the shallowness of the sea. My only concern was a complete lack of shade, so I strolled along the waterline and soon came to a crop of beach chairs and umbrellas belonging to one of the fancy hotels. There were plenty of empty chairs and, trying my luck, I staked my claim. No one was in the least perturbed, and I happily spent the day alternating between swimming in jellyfish-netted area of the ocean and reading in the shade.

The only bummer was that I arrived back at the hostel so late that the few nearby shops were all closed and so I couldn't get any food. There weren't many other guests, and it felt like I was staying at someone's beachhouse. The owners are a lovely couple and the woman had spent some time living in Australia, including, of all places, Diamond Creek.
