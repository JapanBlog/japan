A travel day, as I fly from Ishigaki in the very south of Japan to Sapporo on the northermost main island of Hokkaido. The flight was straightforward, with a brief stopover in Tokyo to change planes. I'm still feeling pretty rubbish, but my sore throat has gone and I think I'll be able to avoid a visit to the doctor (which would be pretty challenging, I think).
