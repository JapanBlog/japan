Fukuoka is the most populous city in Kyushu, the most southerly of Japan's main islands. I arrived last evening but didn't do any more than walk around the neighbourhood looking for some dinner. I also noticed the bicycles out the front of the hotel and was pleased to find out that these were free to borrow. So off I cycled towards that next morning.

Following a main road, I (unsurprisingly) ended up in a major shopping district. Rats to that, I then followed a river to where it meets the sea. There I found the fish market. Although the market itself not open to the public, there are several restaurants where you can try the local seafood. I had a cheap and tasty bowl of sashimi and rice, an example of the popular Japanese "rice bowl dish" called [donburi (丼)](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Donburi).  
Next to the restaurant was a hairdressers - most hairdressers in Japan still seem to have the blue, white, and red swirled barber's pole out front even when unisex (I think). I actually haven't been to a hairdresser in a few years because it's pretty simple to shave your own head with clippers. Since I'd forgotten to bring mine, however, I decided to get a tidy up. Even though I was getting the simplest possible haircut - clippers all over - it was a pretty decent test of my language skills to explain this to the female owner. But after a couple of rounds ending in me saying "もっと短い" (literally, "more short"), we got there.

As soon as I jumped back on the bike I knew I'd be needing something else - a hat! I'm not a hat person, but there was no avoiding it since I was spending many hours wandering around each day under the hot and cloud-free Japanese skies. So back to Tenjin I cycled and into Uniqlo to buy a hat and sunglasses - [Guy Incognito](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Guy_Incognito).

Thusly disguised, I snuck into (okay, accidentally entered while looking for a restaurant) some fancy bar dressed in T-shirt, shorts, and thongs, and was duly compelled to order a cocktail. Fortunately, cocktails are considerably cheaper in Japan than they are in Australia and so my [Charlie Chaplin](http://cocktails.about.com/od/brandyrecipes/r/charlie_chaplin.htm) (chosen since I could read its Japanese-written name on the menu) didn't break the bank.

I eventually found _Ramen Stadium_, where eight ramen shops of varying styles compete to determine ["Whose cuisine reigns supreme?"](https://youtu.be/1TdA_yP8sV8). I wanted to try the Hakata-style ramen (Hakata being a ward of Fukuoka city), which uses a broth made by boiling pork bones (tonkotsu, 豚骨). The broth is very rich and creamy, delicious, but I couldn't eat it too often.

Heading back to the hotel I checked out the popular yatai (屋台), small food stalls that open each evening and are signatures of Fukuoka.
