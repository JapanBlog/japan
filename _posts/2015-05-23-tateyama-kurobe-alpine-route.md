Continuing my adventures in the great outdoors, today took the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route. I took the route in the opposite direction to most, beginning at the Kurobe Dam. This is the highest dam in Japan and it was a dizzying view to the river below.

The route is traversed using a combination of train, funicular, bus, trolleybus, aerial tramway, and old-fashioned walking, to pass around, over, under and across the Hida Mountains.

My favourite part of the trip was around Tateyama (lit. Mt Tate). Here there was plenty of snow, but it was warm enough that I could comfortably walk around for a couple of hours in a t-shirt and jeans. I walked around the Mikurigaike volcanic pond and past the holes of Jigokudani (Hell Valley) that were gently releasing a pungent sulphuric steam.

In the distance I could see groups of mountaineers tackling the various peaks.

The drawcard of the Alpine Route at this time of the year is the snow wall at Yukino-≈çtani. At the beginning of the season in April, the wall stands 19 metres high. In late May it has decreased in height somewhat, but was still an impressive sight to walk and drive through.

After arriving in Tateyama, I caught a train to Takayama, where I would spend the next two nights. For dinner I went to a popular spot that serves great American-style burgers.
