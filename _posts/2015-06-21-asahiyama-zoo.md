My plans for Hokkaido were thrown a curveball by the need for an International Driver's Licence in order to rent a car. There are many beautiful looking national parks but they are almost all inaccessible without a car. I really wanted to see the natural beauty of Hokkaido and was able to make a plan that only required public transport. The first stop on my five day trip of Hokkaido is the city of Asahikawa, and the nearby Asahiyama zoo. Kawa, 川, means "river" and yama, 山, means "mountain" in Japanese - I'll leave the rest as an exercise to the reader.

The trains in Hokkaido are noticeably slower and less frequent than in Honshu. The shinkansen will connect Hokkaido to Honshu beginning in 2016 but will not be completed until 2030. Dairy farming is a large industry in Hokkaido, and the train to Asahikawa passed by many farms. The weather is much cooler, and less humid, than in other parts of Japan, especially having come from Okinawa Prefecture. It made a nice change.

I had a chat with the woman next to me on the train after she offered me a lozenge, probably sick to death of me coughing away. She helped me find the bus from Asahikawa station to Asahiyama zoo; another example of Japanese hospitality. The zoo was a great way to spend an afternoon.

My favourite displays were the chimpanzees, apes and other monkeys, as always, and I happily spent a long time watching them at play.

From Asahikawa, I had a long journey north to Wakkanai. Wakkanai is a quiet town, probably most notable as a port to the popular tourist destinations of Rebun island (my ultimate destination) and Rishiri island, as well as a connection to Sakhalin, Russia. A long-running joke about Wakkanai (稚内) is that it sounds very similar to "wakannai" (分かんない) the Japanese phrase for "I do not understand/I do not know" - so when you say "I am going to Wakkanai" it is easily misinterpreted as "I don't understand where I'm going", which might be many people's attitudes about going to Wakkanai.
