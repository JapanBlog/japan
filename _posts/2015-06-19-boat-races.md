I woke up feeling much the same as I had the night before. As I rolled over to go back to sleep, Hiro-san, the friendly and helpful owner of the hostel, came in to remind us that today was the Fisherman's Festival. I had been told a little bit about the festival by Hiro-san when I arrived, but only to the extent that I knew there were boat races at some point and that we were all welcome to join in. Sounded like fun to me! With this encouragement, I threw on some clothes and headed to the local beach with him and some others from the hostel.

Upon arrival, at 9AM, we were greeted with a cold, cooked piece of fish and an ice cold can of beer. This was breakfast, apparently. There were tables set up under a bunch of marquees along the beach, and so we grabbed a spot amongst the locals. I was immediately offered a cup of _Awamori_, a local spirit similar to sake. Not wanting to turn down the hospitality, I accepted and gingerly sipped on the half-and-half cup _Awamori_ and water. It was pretty potent stuff.

In front of us was a stage and an MC was talking away. After a few minutes introduction, a group of local schoolkids took the stage to perform a few dances. They had obviously been practicing and took great pride in their performance. It was a really fun show and I managed to get a few good photos from up the back.

It was now time for the boat races. Each boat seated around 10 people, two abreast, and was padelled like a canoe. Each race was a head-to-head between two boats. After a few races by the seemingly more professional entrants, we were invited up to join a team. I had great fun chanting along with my crewmates but sadly we weren't fast enough to win our heat.

While we were having the happy snaps taken, I was asked to compete in the next heat.

I was pretty knackered from the first race, but said I would be happy to, so long as I could paddle on the opposite side! We again lost (not my doing, I swear). After a full morning we wandered back to the hostel.

Ishigaki is much bigger than Miyakojima and difficult to get around without a car. You can't rent a car without an International Driver's Licence, which unfortunately I did not know beforehand. But a Japanese guy staying at the hostel had rented a car for the day, so me, Andreas, and Elvy, split the rent with him and headed for a tour of the island in the afternoon.

We stopped at a nice lookout and went to a nearby pineapple farm, which was sadly closed due to the Fisherman's Festival.

Continuing on, we had a nice swim and then went to another beach recommended to us for snorkelling. This didn't have a patch on [Yoshino Beach]({% post_url 2015-06-15-yoshino-beach %}), however, and was a bit of a disappointment, I thought. Also, by this stage I was again feeling rotten with my sore throat and cold. We ended the day at the Uganzaki Lighthouse, but our plans to watch the sunset were thwarted by low cloud cover.

The others went for dinner in Ishigaki City while I caught a cab back to the hostel to get some sleep. My time in Ishigaki was spoilt by my sickness and there were several other things, like kayaking through the mangroves on nearby Iriomote island, that I would have loved to have done. _C'est la vie_.
