It wasn't as wet as the forecast had predicted, which made for a decent day sight-seeing around Hiroshima. I walked to the Hiroshima Peace Park that was established as a memorial to the victims of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima on 6 August, 1945.

The park contains a couple of museums and several memorials dedicated to different groups of victims and to world peace. These dedications are understandably somber, but the Children's Peace Monument is a colourful display of origami made by student's from all over the world.

Speaking of children, there were lots of schoolkids visiting the park. Seemingly all of these were from a particular elementary school in Osaka and I was stopped by three separate groups for an interview. Speaking in English (sometimes read from a cheat sheet, other times from memory), they introduced themselves, explained that they were studying world peace, and asked whether they could ask me some questions:

1. What is my name?
2. Where am I from?
3. Why am I visiting Hiroshima Peace Park?

After noting my answers on their ubiquitous clipboards, I was given origami as thanks. With my hands full of paper frogs, flowers, and cranes, I eventually managed to make it to the other side of the park and enter the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.

The stories and artefacts on display were horrific. To me, the personal stories of survivors, particularly the video interviews right by the exit, were the most moving and powerful. Since the majority of victims were civilians, the exhibits paid most attention to stories from ordinary citizens, perhaps at the expense of not putting the bombing in the broader context of World War II - I don't know, I'm no historian.

I concluded my visit in the reflective beauty of the Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims.
