An early start on a wet day to visit Kōyasan. Kōyasan is a World Heritage site and the headquarters of Kōyasan Shingon sect of Japanese Buddhism. The train up into the hills would have provided a great view but for the mist and cloud from a low altitude.

Following a 2 hour or so train journey was a cable car crawl up the mountain.

There are many temples to visit in Kōyasan. I went to a couple of the main ones, Danjogaran and Kongōbu-ji, but the constant rain put a dampener on things.

At the edge of town was a hiking track, but I didn't have time since I had to get back to Osaka by 7pm for dinner with Yuki-san, my Airbnb host. Oh, and there were signs warning of bears.

A popular tourist activity in Kōyasan is to stay overnight at one of the Buddhist temples. An overnight stay includes the opportunity to eat food prepared by the strictly vegetarian monks. Several of the local restaurants also offer this vegetarian fare, and so I went to _Hanabishi_ to try some. Vegetarianism, if not vegetarian food, is relatively rare in Japan, with most dishes containing fish or meat (either as pieces of meat or as part of a broth).

The lunch I had included peach wine, eggplant in bean paste (__AMAZING__), and sesame tofu. Each dish looked very simple and beautiful, and this was the best meal I have eaten in Japan. Absolutely delicious!

That night I went to dinner with Yuki-san, his wife, and three of his English language students. We went to a fun conveyor belt sushi restaurant. You could order from a touch screen and have your dish zipped out to your table or choose from the slowly passing parade of plates. When you finished each plate, which typically contained one or two pieces of sushi, you deposited the plate in a slot that kept count for your bill. After 5 plates you got to play a game on the touchscreen and could win a small prize. Pretty pointless, but equally fun.
