There is excellent scuba diving in Okinawa Prefecture. The addition of Okinawa to my trip was spontaneous, however, and I wasn't well organised for this. Initially disappointed, I was happy to learn that the snorkelling is also excellent and doesn't require as much preparation (like remembering to bring your diving log book). What's more, the guesthouse had snorkelling gear that was free to borrow and some of the best spots didn't require a boat to get to. So I was very excited today to go explore the sea.

The only snag (of the metaphorical variety) was that the number one beach on Miyakojima for snorkelling was some 23km away from the guesthouse. And public transport can safely be summarised as non-existant. The guesthouse did have bicyles, however, and, in spite of skepticism from my hosts, I jumped on a rusted old thing to pedal to Yoshino Beach.

Holy crap. This was probably the most difficult ride I've ever done. The distance would take me around an hour on my own bike, but conditions were slightly more difficult that riding the Yarra Trail. Firstly, the rust on the chain meant that I only had a single gear available, the heaviest of the (theoretical) six gears.

Secondly, it was 34 degrees with 100% humidity. I had the sun beating down on me for the entire ride and my hat was soaked through with sweat. Finally, Miyakojima is much hillier than it first appears! There were several points along the ride where I had to stop and push my bike uphill. And other points where I had to get off to walk my bike downhill since the front brakes of the bike were best described as "cosmetic". Nonetheless, I made it! And it was worth every bit of sweat and effort.

Unlike Yonaha-Maehama Beach, Yoshino Beach had no nearby hotels. Some enterprising locals, however, rented out tables, chairs and umbrellas for $10 and you could buy food and cold drinks.

Following a tasty yakisoba for an early lunch, I put on my snorkel and flippers and wandered into the water. It was low tide and the water was barely deep enough to allow you to swim over the lowest coral. But the tropical fish, or "Nemos" as they are seemingly all known in Japan, were abundant. From ankle-deep water you could already spot a variety of dazzling fish. I wish I'd had a underwater camera with which to take photographs because it is difficult in words to do justice to its beauty.

While taking a break from the water at my table, a local man in a kind of zoo keeper outfit approached me for a chat. He was the guardian of Yoshino beach, and has helped kept it clean and welcomed visitors for decades. He told me this history and asked that I take care not to touch the coral and fish when snorkelling (more difficult than it sounds given the density of fish living here). He also gave me a simple necklace of a piece of coral (産後) on a string as a memento of my visit.

The snorkelling only got better as the tide came in, allowing access to different parts of the reef. The ride back was easier, probably because I was so happy after a wonderful day. The route ran mostly by sugarcane farms and the smell of cow shit used as manure strongly reminded me of Nan and Pa's farm in Katandra West.
