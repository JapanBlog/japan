Nara was the capital of Japan from 710 to 794, and is an easy day trip from Kyoto or Osaka. The major sites are centred around Nara Park, a 15 minute walk from Nara station.

First to greet you upon your arrival at Nara Park are its famous deer.

These animals are free to roam around, but are very used to human contact. I suspect that's got something to do with the rice biscuits you can buy and feed to the deer for a couple of bucks (\*rimshot\*). Actually, "feeding" might be too generous. As soon as a deer (more likely, deers) spots that you have said biscuits, then they will quickly surround the <strike>hapless victim</strike> person and try to eat as many as they can as quickly as they can. It's very funny watching somebody flap around as she is surrounded by a pack of eager and inquisitive deer.

There were many groups of primary (elementary) school kids in Nara. In most of these groups there was one kid who was being egged on by his mates to say "hello" to the foreigner (this kid was always a boy, in my experience). It was fun to see their shock when I replied in Japanese. As basic as it may be, I am almost always greeted with a fair degree of surprise when I speak Japanese. The kids definitely have the best reactions and will often ask you a few questions.

One other thing on Japanese school kids, well, school kids in general. Baggy pants or short skirts, untucked shirts, and "interesting" haircuts - these are the seemingly universal signs of the "cool" kids.

The temples and shrines of Nara were some of my favourites. The Great Buddha of Tōdai-ji, the largest seated bronze Buddha statue in Japan, was particularly spectacular.

Back in Kyoto, I tried Okonomiyaki (お好み焼き) for dinner. Okonomiyaki is a local favourite of the Kansai and Hiroshima areas and is commonly described to Westerners as a Japanese pizza/omelette/pancake. I reckon "omelette" comes closest to the truth. It's a whole host of ingredients - green onion, meat, seafood, vegetables, cheese, and more - that is cooked on a hot plate, oftentimes at your table. A simple and filling meal that would make a tasty after-work dinner.
