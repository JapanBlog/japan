It wasn't as wet as the forecast had predicted, which made for a decent day sight-seeing around Hiroshima. I walked to the Hiroshima Peace Park that was established as a memorial to the victims of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 (__CHECK__).

The park contains a museum, __WHAT ELSE__, and several statue dedicated to different groups of victims and to world peace. These dedications are understandably somber, but the __CHILDREN'S DEDICATION TO WORLD PEACE__ is a colourful display of origami made by student's from all over the world.

Speaking of children, there were lots of schoolkids visiting the park. Seemingly all of these were from a particular elementary school in Osaka and I was stopped by three separate groups for an interview. Speaking in English (sometimes read from a cheat sheet, othertimes from memory), they introduced themselves, explained that they were studying world peace, and asked whether they could ask me some questions:

1. What is my name?
2. Where am I from?
3. Why am I visiting Hiroshima Peace Park?

After noting my answers on their uniquituous clipboards, I was given a piece of origami as thanks. With my hands full of origami I eventually managed to walk to the other side of the park and enter the __MUSEUM__.
