- Bloody difficult 22km ride on a rusted old bike
  - Ride home easier, more downhill.
  - The smell of cow shit on the crops reminding me of Nan and Pa's farm.
- Magnificent snorkelling
  - Low tide when arrived, high tide even better
  - Wish I'd had an underwater camera
- That old bloke who gave me a coral necklace
- Female owner was in Australia 22 years ago. Stayed in Diamond Creek with the family of an Aussie she met in a English conversation class in Toyko!
- Got the aircon working - much more comfortable!
- Accommodation is like staying in someone's beachhouse
