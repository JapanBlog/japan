- Universal studios, mostly to see Harry Potter World
  - Got there around 8:10AM for a 9:30AM opening. Already people lining up. But did mean that I was able to get straight into HP without a timed ticket.
  - Butter beer is freaking delicious
  - The Harry Potter 4K ride was brilliant (enjoyed more each time around, 4 times in total)
- Checked out some other rides around 11AM
  - Spiderman x2
  - Backdraft
    - Mystifying first two segments, but the last was pretty cool. Heat from fire was real.
  - Woody Woody Pecker animation
    - Surprisingly fun, even without knowing Japanese.
  - Jaws
    - Fucking brilliant! The boat's skipper was excellent and I got pretty wet.
- Back to HP with a timed ticket (probably didn't need it)
  - Lunch at the 3 broomsticks (MOAHBUTTAHBEER)
  - Lines were very short, 80 minutes posted but through in 45 minutes tops, I reckon. Completed Northern Lights trilogy while waiting in line.
  - Checked out the shops. All manner of merchandise, and the most dangerous part cause it's EXPENSIVE.
- Why people don't use the single rider line is beyond me. Reduced an 60+ minute wait to ~5 minutes.
