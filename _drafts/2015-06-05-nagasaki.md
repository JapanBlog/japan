Well, I just came the closest I have to missing my train. I also got to experience the Japanese subway crush, with the added inconvenience of my big backpack. I had to skip the first two trains because I simply couldn't get on, and by then I felt I had to get on the next train. However, stupid me forgot to check where this next train was actually going...Some backtracking and two train changes later, I made my train to Nagasaki with a couple of minutes to spare. It wouldn't really have mattered had I miseed it, still, CRISIS AVERTED.

It's a two hour journey from Fukuoka since Nagasaki isn't served by the Shinkansen. Out the window it's a very wet and grey looking day, so I'm not yet sure what I'll get up to once I arrive.

- Penguin aquarium
