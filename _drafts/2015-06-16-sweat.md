- Went down for a swim at the beach near the resort
- Borrowed a bike to get lunch at Pani Pani
  - Absolutely drenched in sweat, like I'd just walked out of the ocean
  - Delicious blue heaven spider ("cream soda")! And taco pizza!
- Plane to Ishigaki
- Had a chat with roommates, Tony(?, England/Wales) and David (France)
- Sat out one roof drinking beer and writing. Until the mosquitoes...
