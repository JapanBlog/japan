- An early start, up at 6AM, for a 3 hour trip. But missed first train
- A drizzly day, misty up in the mountains.
- Train from Hashimoto to Koya-san is on a continual upward slope.
- Have to keep to time because going to dinner at high-tech sushi place with Yuki-san and some of his English students tonight.
- Wet, wet, wet.
  - Hike would have been nice, but not enough time and weather crappy. Oh, and BEARS
- Lunch was the best meal I've eaten in Japan - all vegetarian and all delicious.
- A fun dinner with Yuki-san, his wife, and 3 of his English students, at a high-tech sushi restaurant.
