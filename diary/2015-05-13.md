Today was my favourite day of my week in Tokyo. I booked a cycling tour with [Tokyo Great Cycling Tour](www.tokyocycling.jp) upon the recommendation of a woman whom works with Mum. I can happily second the recommendation, it was great fun!

Our guides on the [Route C](http://www.tokyocycling.jp/route_c.html) trip were Miki and Yukiko. Both women were great fun, as well as informative, and tolerated my rusty Japanese in spite of their own excellent English. Our 26km ride through Tokyo jumped between the road and the footpath at will. Yep, the footpath is fare game in Japan and it made the ride all the more fun as we weaved through traffic and amongst pedestrians. The bike I rode was smaller than my own back home, but all bikes were new and much better than any rental I've used elsewhere.

After riding alongside the river, we stopped at the man-made island of Shinkawa (新川). There we tried the local delicacy, tiny fish covered in sugar and soy sauce. They reminded me of sardines and I would happily eat these in a jaffle with grilled cheese. The ride continued at this easy pace through Western Tokyo - a bit of cycling followed by a stop to learn about the local area and often to try some local food or drink. We stopped at a sweets shop (sampling is alive and well in Japan, much to my delight), had lunch at Yoyogi Park and grabbed a mid-afternoon beer near the site of the 2020 Olympic Stadium. We also visited the Meiji shrine (the first of many shrines and temples in my trip, I'm sure), [dedicated to the deified spirits of Emperor Meiji ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Shrine),  who led Japan during the Industrial Revolution.

As great as the cycling was, and it was bloody fantastic, the best part of the day was yet to come. Returning to the shop at around 3:30pm, Miki and Ayako kindly offered us a beer as our group of ten sat around chatting. The topic of [sake (Japanese rice wine)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sake) came up and Miki offered to take anyone interested to a place she knew where we could sample a few different varieties. Along with three others, Stefan and Lucas from Germany and Maria from Columbia, we walked to a nearby sake shop.

A young guy who worked at the shop brought out five different sakes for us to try, ranging from the more traditional, dry type, to fruitier ones ("for the ladies", pfft, it was damn delicious) and flavoured ones, including [yuzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzu) and ginger. When we got our wallets out to pay our very kind host, these were promptly waved back into our pockets. We continued to chat, tried some dried miniature squid (aka _essence de poissons_), and then our host brought out his [_sanshin_ (三線, literally "three strings")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanshin), a three-stringed instrument native to the islands of Okinawa, his ancestral home. We were treated to a tune and danced around his shop. I even got to play the sanshin, the body of which is wrapped in snakeskin, the neck having no frets, and is plucked using a polished piece of buffalo's horn that looks like a dinosaur's talon.

Following this unexpected bonus, Stefan, Lucas, Maria and I grabbed dinner and beers at a yakitori-ya. Think of yakitori as basically meat on a skewer. It might perhaps be as much as you wish to think about it because they are not shy about using every bit of the animal. Heart, liver, intestine, skin, fat, "giblets", all are fair game in yakitori. We decided to order mixed plates of yakitori - an "eat first, ask questions later" approach - which meant that we enjoyed (for the most part) all the different types without any preconceived ideas. A great end to a wonderful day that highlighted the generous Japanese hospitality.
