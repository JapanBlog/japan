After a good night's sleep (in spite of the [traditional Japanese buckwheat pillow](https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=japanese+pillow&oq=japanese+pil&aqs=chrome.1.69i59l2j0j69i57j0l2.2598j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8) and the 4:30am sunrise) I was ready to begin my dive into Japanese culture. Up first, a sushi making class with [Buddha Bellies Cooking School](http://buddhabelliestokyo.jimdo.com/).

Most others in the class were couples, including one from Australia. The most interesting person, however, at least to me, was a young guy named Jin. Why was Jin so interesting? Well, Jin is the first Korean I've ever met who spoke English with a thick Irish accent. Unsurprisingly, Jin said his family were the only Koreans he knew of in Ireland.

Ayuko-san (鮎子さん) was a lovely teacher and the sushi was delicious. Most of the sushi we made was _nigirizushi_ (握り寿司, "hand-pressed sushi"), which I think is my favourite kind. Most noticeably different from the sushi I have eaten outside of Japan is that the pieces of fish were much larger (and more delicious?). Weirdly though, some in the class apparently didn't like raw fish all that much, which kind of seemed to defeat the purpose of attending the class. I happily obliged when asked if anyone wanted the leftovers.
