After a busy first few days, I was in need of some rest. I also needed to make some plans for how I would spend my nearly eight weeks in Japan. Thus far, all I'd really done is bought a return flight to Tokyo.

Apart from trip planning, I read some of the [Emperor of All Maladies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor_of_All_Maladies), a fascinating book on the history of cancer, and explored the local neighbourhood. For dinner I went to the local ramen-ya where I had my first encounter with the process of ordering via vending machine. Up until now I'd favoured places where I could match my translation of the menu with a picture of the dish. Now I was faced with the choice of 40-odd buttons, each with a handwritten label featuring copious lashings of [kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji). One of the staff fortunately spotted by befuddlement and with her help I managed to order more-or-less what I had intended.
