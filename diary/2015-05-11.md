It's finally happening. I'm onboard the "limousine" to my "mansion" in Toyko. In truth, I'm on board a standard coach to the apartment I've rented for the week, but that doesn't take away any of my excitement.

I'm finally on holiday in Japan, a place that I have wanted to travel to for more than five years. The past two previous attempts have been foiled by airline strikes and natural disasters. This time I have almost 8 weeks to experience Japan and to practice my Japanese.

The overnight flight from Melbourne (JQ23) was not the best international flight I've had. I didn't get much sleep during the 10 hour journey and I was a little bit peckish due to Jetstar's (more truthfully, my) tight-arsery.

It's a lovely sunny day in Tokyo. I'm on the highway to the city from Narita airport. The first thing to catch my eye was how green it is. Trees dot the highway in a bed of green and the occasional rice patty. As we get closer to the city the buildings grow more dense, but there are still many trees.

The journey to Tokyo City Air Terminal (TCAT) from Narita airport is a bit over 50 kms. I think that today I will head to Akihabara, the electronics district of Tokyo. I was unable to get a 3-prong Australia-to-Japan power adapter back home, so I really hope I can get one here to keep my gadgets charges. I also need to get an SD card for my camera. But my first port of call will be an ATM and then to lunch!

A few observations while driving:

1. Japanese trucks have really fat steering wheels.
2. Are people allowed to use their phones while driving here?
3. Japanese number plates are deceptively simple: e.g., ひ-77-55.

Once I checked in at Kurumi Mansion I walked to [Akihabara](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3003.html), famous as the electronics district of Tokyo. I went into the largest(?) electronics shop, Yodabashi Electronics. It was suitably crazy. Eight floors of gadgets, hundreds of sales assistants, and loud, repetitive, kitchsy music playing over the PA. I was in search of the elusive three-pronged Australian-to-Japanese power adapter. I later learnt this had been impossible to find in Australia because they are basically illegal tp sell in Australia (all plugs sold in Australia must have the earth pin, I think).

This was my first chance to really use my stilted Japanese and it fortunately proved good enough to obtain what I needed. Adapter in hand, I grabbed some [ramen (ラーメン)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramen) for lunch and wandered around Akihabara and Ueno. As would be the theme for the next few days, I became pretty tired late in the afternoon and headed back to my room to do some planning for the weeks ahead.

A few words on Kurumi Mansion. My room was surprisingly big (for Tokyo), especially considering the price of around $50 per night, and included a small kitchenette and ensuite. It was plenty big enough for me practice my long-neglected yoga which (combined with my habit of walking everywhere when exploring a new city) should help me get some fitness back after a very sedentary last few months PhD-ing.
