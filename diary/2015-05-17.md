Since I'd ended up staying in Tokyo one night longer than I'd planned/guessed, I had to head across town to a different accommodation. The room was slightly smaller...this photo is taken from the opposite corner of the room.

The subway, and the city as a whole, is noticeably different on a Sunday. The obvious change is the city isn't swarming with suits, business attire and school uniforms, although it's still very busy.

I didn't have much of a plan for the afternoon, so I took my book and walked and subway-ed around some other neighbourhoods of Tokyo. After racking up the kilometres, I was keen to try the [soba (そば)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soba) restaurant around the corner from where I was staying. Soba are thin buckwheat noodles that may be served in many different ways. For my dinner, I cold noodles that you dunk in a hot soup before slurping up noisily. Very tasty and, except for if you make the noodles yourself, a simple dish to prepare.
